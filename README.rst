Repository For Packaging Simulator Code Into A Webpage
=======================================

Copy the most recent simulator code into this folder on a user's machine.
Once Jupyter notebooks are run on a user's local machine, copy the tutorials folder with the notebooks into the source directory. 

Then run the following from:

`docs/` directory: 
1) `make clean'
2) `make html'

`maincsg.github.io/` directory
1) `git add .`
2) `git commit -m"<some message>"`
3) `git push`
