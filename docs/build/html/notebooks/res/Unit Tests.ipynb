    "## 1. What are unit test?\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote from: https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html#what-fixtures-are\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a test as being broken down into four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Arrange\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) Act\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) Assert\n",
    "\n",
    "    4) Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arrange** is where we prepare everything for our test. This means pretty much everything except for the “act”. It’s lining up the dominoes so that the act can do its thing in one, state-changing step. This can mean preparing objects, starting/killing services, entering records into a database, or even things like defining a URL to query, generating some credentials for a user that doesn’t exist yet, or just waiting for some process to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Act** is the singular, state-changing action that kicks off the behavior we want to test. This behavior is what carries out the changing of the state of the system under test (SUT), and it’s the resulting changed state that we can look at to make a judgement about the behavior. This typically takes the form of a function/method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assert** is where we look at that resulting state and check if it looks how we’d expect after the dust has settled. It’s where we gather evidence to say the behavior does or does not align with what we expect. The assert in our test is where we take that measurement/observation and apply our judgement to it. If something should be green, we’d say assert thing == \"green\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cleanup** is where the test picks up after itself, so other tests aren’t being accidentally influenced by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At it’s core, the test is ultimately the act and assert steps, with the arrange step only providing the context. Behavior exists between act and assert."

    "- Fixtures are used largely for arrange and act steps\n",

    "- Fixtures can be shared among many tests functions simutaneously\n",
    "- Fixtures can request other fixtures, but the set of fixtures for the pytest must form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)\n",
    "- Fixtures can be automatically accessible to all test functions\n",
    "- Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their scope\n",
    "\n",
    "        - function: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - class: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - module: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "        - session: the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scope of a fixture can be dynamically changed.\n",
    "- Code can be added to clean up or teardown fixtures once the fixture is no longer needed\n",
    "        - \"The safest and simplest fixture structure requires limiting fixtures to only making one state-changing action each, and then bundling them together with their teardown code\"\n"
